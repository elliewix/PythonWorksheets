# PythonWorksheets

Repo to host the Python worksheets project!

## Goal

To create worksheet content suitable for adaptation and printing within the python classroom.

These worksheets should be as atomic as possible, so content can be accumulated and remixed for in classroom and homework use.

These are meant to be drills to practice some of the harder concepts and promote memory of names, conntext use, and styles.

## Questions and scope

The first scope should be the standard library, and suitable for CS1 level content.

But we need to discuss exactly which skill areas are really needed.

* slicing syntax
* looping conventions
* creating appropriately named variables
* looping over sequences and collections, predicting what will be unpacked.
* identifying accumulator patterns

How can these be published so that things can be printed out or turned into a workbook?  How can we publish these that will be useful for educators trying to borrow the materials?

## Agenda

* Intos, who you are in 5 words
* Who would like to do what?
  * someone to come up with a markdown template and/or style guide
  * someone to work on slicing syntax
  * someone to work on another one??
  * someone to help figure out how this could be published in a way that's helpful for the educators trying to reuse things
